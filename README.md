postman collection is sent on email
all APIs completed.
email functionality is not working but code is ready as my email has more authentication that cannot only work by providing email and password. Try from your side if you have email & password. Just need to change env.


env
PORT=8000
DB_URI=mongodb+srv://yash:root@cluster0.dcbmy.mongodb.net/todots
SERVER=http://localhost:8000

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=veryhardpassword
JWT_EXPIRED_IN=2w

# EMAIL
EMAIL=sample@gmail.com
PASSWORD=123456
